# the Odin Project
## Introduction
Welcome to my landing page repository! In this assignment, I've created a web page based on a provided design. The task involved replicating the design as closely as possible, focusing on content layout and styling.

## Project Details
- **Design Images**: 
  - [Image One (Full Design)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)
  - [Image Two (Color and Fonts)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png)
- **Font Used**: Roboto
- **Hero Text**: The statement that appears at the top of a web page.
- **Approach**:
  - I followed the advice to tackle the project one section at a time, starting from the top.
  - I ensured to complete the HTML structure for each section before proceeding to CSS styling.
  - Flexbox exercises were revisited for layout purposes.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Not addressed in this project; it will be covered later.

## Instructions Followed
- **Commit Frequency**: I adhered to the advice of committing early and often throughout the project.
- **Content Development**: Started by getting all content onto the page (HTML) before styling (CSS).
- **Single Stylesheet**: Utilized only one CSS file for the project.
- **Reference to Previous Lessons**: Referred back to flexbox exercises for element layout.

## Completion and Submission
Upon completion, I pushed the project to GitHub to ensure accessibility and sharing.
